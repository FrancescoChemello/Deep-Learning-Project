# DEEP LEARNING PROJECT - REPOSITORY TEMPLATE #
Deep Learning Project - 2023/24 

This repository is a template repository for the homeworks to be developed in the [Deep Learning](https://stem.elearning.unipd.it/course/view.php?id=8201) course.

*Deep Learning* is a course of the

* [Master Degree in Computer Engineering](https://degrees.dei.unipd.it/master-degrees/computer-engineering/) of the  [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dei.unipd.it/en/), [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/), Italy.

## Organisation of the repository ##
The repository is organised as follows:
* code: folder that contains all the code for the homework + files for git.
* presentation: this folder contains the final presentation of the course.
    * slides: this folder contains the slides used for presenting the project.
* developing: contains the files that the group uses for developing the application.

## STRUCTURE ##

1. Retrieve data from .csv files (training, validation and test set).
2. OneHot coding from alphabetic to numeric (4xN matrix, N = sting size).
3. Reshape the PyTorch tensor to fit the data.
4. Implementation of CNN
5. Implementation of LSTM
6. Training the Nets implementing the early stop
6. Run on the test set.
7. Implementation of the ensemble learning for choosing the best label.
8. Performance evaluation: metrics used by ViraMiner.
9. Discussion of results + ppt presentation of work or pdf (as directed by the professor).
